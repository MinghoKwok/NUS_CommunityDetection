# Work

* Collected 1480 images of calligraphy using Web Crawler with Python and divided them into 74 classes.

* Used Siamese neural network with SCIKIT-LEARN package of Python to generate dissimilarity matrix of
different calligraphersâ€™ work.

* Applied community detection algorithms and got 4 clusters by parameter tuning, then used data visualiza-
tion(gephi) to find relationships among different characters and calligraphers of Chinese calligraphy.
