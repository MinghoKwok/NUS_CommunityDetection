# NUS_CommunityDetection
NUS SOC Summer Workshop   Jul. 2019 - Aug. 2019

• Collected 1480 images of calligraphy using Web Crawler with Python and divided them into 74 classes.
• Used Siamese neural network with SCIKIT-LEARN package of Python to generate dissimilarity matrix of
different calligraphers’ work.
• Applied community detection algorithms and got 4 clusters by parameter tuning, then used data visualiza-
tion(gephi) to find relationships among different characters and calligraphers of Chinese calligraphy.
